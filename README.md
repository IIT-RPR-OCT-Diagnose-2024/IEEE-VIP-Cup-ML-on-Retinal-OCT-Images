# Classification of Noisy Low Resolution OCT Retinal Images

We are the IIT Ropar Team participating in the IEEE VIP CUP 2024 (Signal Processing Society). This project is under the supervision of Dr. Puneet Goyal, Associate Professor, Department of CSE, IIT Ropar.

### Team Members: Ankush Naskar, Satvik Srivastava, Hemlata Gautam, Ashish Gupta, Utkarsh Patel
### Faculty Supervisor: Dr. Puneet Goyal

## Project Details
### IEEE SPS Video and Image Processing Cup at IEEE ICIP 2024 SS-OCT Image Analysis

The challenge consists of the following three tasks:
1) De-noising of noisy OCT images
2) Super-resolution
3) Volume-based classification of OCT dataset into several ocular disease sub-classes

Final Submission of Teamâ€™s Work Deadline: 15 June 2024 <br>
Announcement of 3 finalist teams: 15 July 2024 <br>
Final competition at International Conference on Image Processing 2024, Abu Dhabi: October 27-30, 2024 <br>
