# Classification of Noisy Low Resolution OCT Retinal Images

### Finalist Team in IEEE VIP CUP 2024 (Signal Processing Society)

We are thrilled to be among the top 3 **Global Finalist Teams** in the **IEEE VIP CUP 2024** (Signal Processing Society). Representing IIT Ropar, our project is supervised by Dr. Puneet Goyal, Associate Professor, Department of CSE at IIT Ropar.

### Team Members: Ankush Naskar, Satvik Srivastava, Hemlata Gautam, Ashish Gupta, Utkarsh Patel
### Faculty Supervisor: Dr. Puneet Goyal

## Project Details
### IEEE SPS Video and Image Processing Cup at IEEE ICIP 2024 SS-OCT Image Analysis

The challenge consists of the following three tasks:
1) De-noising of noisy OCT images
2) Super-resolution
3) Volume-based classification of OCT dataset into several ocular disease sub-classes
